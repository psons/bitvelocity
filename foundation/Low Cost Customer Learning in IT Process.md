In [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Startup_Owner_s_Manual/eSrfDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover), Steve Blank and Bob Dorf create a mantra of “Get Out of the Office” meaning that one should get out and talk to customers as means of both idea discovery and understanding of customer need at low cost.

The idea is an essential complement to the idea that “you don't know anything about your product until you build it”.   Steve Blank and the startup community eschew this idea and emphasize the  need to learn about your customers / users at low cost by simply talking to them.   

IT specification tools and processes can be used to facilitate customer conversation by advising the feasibility of different design alternatives.  IT design can iterate with the customer feedback in many cases without building anything.  

The IT scope definition process should be advised by customer feedback on proposed features.

Any step that provides more clear understanding for product owners and stakeholders to advise direction is valuable.  

Business owners can often provide immediate feedback on costly design choices once they understand the design trade offs.
